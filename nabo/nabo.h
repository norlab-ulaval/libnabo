from http://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo by Stéphane Magnenat (http://stephane.magnenat.net),
ASL-ETHZ, Switzerland (http://www.asl.ethz.ch)

libnabo is a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low-dimensional spaces.
It provides a clean, legacy-free, scalar-type–agnostic API thanks to C++ templates.
Its current CPU implementation is strongly inspired by \ref ANN, but with more compact data types.
On the average, libnabo is 5% to 20% faster than \ref ANN.

libnabo depends on \ref Eigen, a modern C++ matrix and linear-algebra library.
libnabo works with either version 2 or 3 of Eigen.
libnabo also depends on \ref Boost, a C++ general library.

\section Compilation

libnabo uses \ref CMake as build system.
The complete compilation process depends on the system you are using (Linux, Mac OS X or Windows).
You will find a nice introductory tutorial in this you tube video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLvZTyji_Uw.

\subsection Prerequisites

If your operating system does not provide it, you must get \ref Eigen.
\ref Eigen only needs to be downloaded and extracted.

\subsection CompilationOptions Compilation options

libnabo provides the following compilation options, available through \ref CMake :
 - \c SHARED_LIBS (boolean, default: \c false): if \c true, build a shared library, otherwise build a static library

You specify them with a command-line tool, \c ccmake, or with a graphical tool, \c cmake-gui.
Please read the <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/cmake2.6docs.html">CMake documentation</a> for more information.

\subsection QuickCompilationUnix Quick compilation and installation under Unix

Under Unix, assuming that \ref Eigen is installed system-wide, you can compile (with optimisation and debug information) and install libnabo in \c /usr/local with the following commands run in the top-level directory of libnabo's sources:
\code
SRC_DIR=`pwd`
BUILD_DIR=${SRC_DIR}/build
mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR} && cd ${BUILD_DIR}
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ${SRC_DIR}
# if Eigen is not available system-wide, run at that point:
#   cmake-gui .
# cmake-gui allows you to tell the location of Eigen
make
sudo make install
\endcode

These lines will compile libnabo in a \c build sub-directory and therefore keep your source tree clean.
Note that you could compile libnabo anywhere you have write access, such as in \c /tmp/libnabo.
This out-of-source build is a nice feature of \ref CMake.
If \ref Eigen is not installed system-wide, you might have to tell \ref CMake where to find them (using \c ccmake or \c cmake-gui).

You can generate the documentation by typing:
\code
make doc
\endcode

\section Usage

libnabo is easy to use. For example, assuming that you are working with floats and that you have a point set \c M and a query point \c q, you can find the \c K nearest neighbours of \c q in \c M :

\include trivial.cpp

In this example, \c M is an \ref Eigen (refering to the software, not to the math) matrix (column major, float) and \c q is an \ref Eigen vector (float).
The results \c indices and \c dists2 are \ref Eigen vectors of indices and squared distances refering to the columns of \c M.

Here is a slightly more complex example:

\include usage.cpp

Note that the matrix-based interface for query is more efficient than the vector-based one, because some sanity checks can be done only once. Therefore, if you have multiple points to query, we warmly suggest to pass them as a matrix instead of calling \c knn() multiple times.

\section ConstructionParameters Construction parameters

The following additional construction parameters are available in KDTREE_ algorithms:
- \c bucketSize (\c unsigned): bucket size, defaults to 8

\section UnitTesting Unit testing

The distribution of libnabo integrates a unit test module, based on CTest.
Just type:

\code
make test
\endcode
   
...in the build directory to run the tests.
Their outputs are available in the \c Testing directory.
These consist of validation and benchmarking tests.
If \ref ANN is detected when compiling libnabo, \c make \c test will also perform comparative benchmarks.

\section Faq

\subsection ANN

libnabo differs from \ref ANN on the following points:

* API
- templates for scalar type
- self-match option as execution-time (instead of compile-time) parameter
- range search instead of radius search
- \ref Eigen library for vector and matrixes
- reentrant

* limitations
- only euclidean distance
- only KD-tree, no BD-tree
- only ANN_KD_SL_MIDPT splitting rules

* implementation
- optional O(log(n)) tree heap instead of O(n) vector heap
- compact memory representation, one memory allocation for all nodes, 5-fold smaller memory footprint compared than ANN
- implicit reference to left child (always next node in array)
- do not store bounds in nodes (that is, I do it like in ANN's article instead of like in ANN's source code)

* performances
- about 5% to 20% faster than ANN (both -O3 -NDEBUG), probably due to the smaller memory footprint
- clearly memory-bound, neither OpenMP nor boost::thread improve performances
