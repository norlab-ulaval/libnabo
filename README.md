libnabo is a fast K Nearest Neighbour library for low-dimensional spaces.
It provides a clean, legacy-free, scalar-type–agnostic API thanks to C++ templates.
Its current CPU implementation is strongly inspired by [ANN], but with more compact data types.
On the average, libnabo is 5% to 20% faster than [ANN].

libnabo depends on [Eigen], a modern C++ matrix and linear-algebra library.
libnabo works with either version 2 or 3 of Eigen.
libnabo also depends on [Boost], a C++ general library.

libnabo was developed by [Stéphane Magnenat](http://stephane.magnenat.net) as part of his work at [ASL-ETH](http://www.asl.ethz.ch) and is now maintained by [Simon Lynen](https://github.com/simonlynen).

Download
========

Ubuntu builds are available on my PPA at: https://launchpad.net/~stephane.magnenat
They provide a package with the shared library, another with the development headers and a third with the documentation.

The source code is available from github, you can clone the git tree by doing:

	git clone git://github.com/ethz-asl/libnabo.git


Compilation
===========

libnabo uses [CMake] as build system.
The complete compilation process depends on the system you are using (Linux, Mac OS X or Windows).
You will find a nice introductory tutorial in [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CLvZTyji_Uw).

Prerequisites
-------------

If your operating system does not provide it, you must get [Eigen] and [Boost].
[Eigen] only needs to be downloaded and extracted.

Compilation options
-------------------

libnabo provides the following compilation options, available through [CMake]:

* `NABO_EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR` (string, default: `""`, *advanced*): libnabo supports both legacy Eigen 2, as well as modern Eigen 3.  By default, libnabo will search for the package Eigen3.  If you desire to use Eigen 2 you need to set this variable.  For example, `cmake .. -DNABO_EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR='/usr/local/include/eigen2'`.  This can also be used to specify an alternative Eigen 3 installation to be used **instead** of trying `find_package`.
* `NABO_EXPORT_PACKAGE` (boolean, default: `OFF`) If `ON`, `export(PACKAGE libnabo)` will be executed.  This means that the binary directory (where you are *building* libnano) *will* be found when a different project executes `find_package(libnabo)`.  This can provide convenience, but may also conflict with installations -- the build directory may be selected before the installed directory.  Users are encouraged to leave this as `OFF` and complete the installation cycle (see next section), unless they know what they are doing.
* `NABO_SHARED_LIBS` (boolean, default: `OFF`): if `ON`, build a shared library, otherwise build a static library.
* `NABO_DOC_INSTALL_TARGET` (string, default: `share/doc/nabo/api`): optionally specify where to install the doxygen generated documentation.  The actual installation path will be `${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/${NABO_DOC_INSTALL_TARGET}`.  For example, the default `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is typically `/usr/local`, so with the default of this variable API documentation will be installed in `/usr/local/share/doc/nabo/api`.
* `NABO_USE_OPEN_MP` (boolean default: `ON`): if `ON`, and OpenMP is supported by the current compiler, use OpenMP for parallel tree operations.
* `NABO_USE_OPEN_CL` (boolean, default: `OFF`): OpenCL support at this time is not in sync with the rest of the API, but this may change in the future.

You can specify them with a command-line tool, `ccmake`, or with a graphical tool, `cmake-gui`.
Please read the [CMake documentation] for more information.

Quick compilation and installation under Unix
---------------------------------------------

Under Unix, assuming that [Eigen] and [Boost] are installed system-wide, you can compile (with optimisation and debug information) and install libnabo in `/usr/local` with the following commands run in the top-level directory of libnabo's sources:

	SRC_DIR=`pwd`
	BUILD_DIR=${SRC_DIR}/build
	mkdir -p ${BUILD_DIR} && cd ${BUILD_DIR}
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ${SRC_DIR}
	# if Eigen or Boost are not available system-wide, run at that point:
	#   cmake-gui .
	# cmake-gui allows you to tell the location of Eigen or Boost
	make
	sudo make install

These lines will compile libnabo in a `build` sub-directory and therefore keep your source tree clean.
Note that you could compile libnabo anywhere you have write access, such as in `/tmp/libnabo`.
This out-of-source build is a nice feature of [CMake].
If [Eigen] or [Boost] are not installed system-wide, you might have to tell [CMake] where to find them (using `ccmake` or `cmake-gui`).

You can generate the documentation by typing:

	make doc

Usage
=====

libnabo is easy to use. For example, assuming that you are working with floats and that you have a point set `M` and a query point `q`, you can find the `K` nearest neighbours of `q` in `M`:

	#include "nabo/nabo.h"
	using namespace Nabo;
	using namespace Eigen;
	...
	NNSearchF* nns = NNSearchF::createKDTreeLinearHeap(M);

	const int K = 5;
	VectorXi indices(K);
	VectorXf dists2(K);

	nns->knn(q, indices, dists2, K);

In this example, `M` is an [Eigen] (refering to the software, not to the math) matrix (column major, float) and `q` is an [Eigen] vector (float). Note that `M` **must stay alive** throughout the use of libnabo, otherwise the results of `knn` are undefined.
The results `indices` and `dists2` are [Eigen] vectors of indices and squared distances refering to the columns of `M`.
See `examples/trivial.cpp` for a compilable version of this example, and `examples/usage.cpp` for a slightly more complex example involving multi-point queries.

Running `make doc` in your build directory will generate a browsable documentation in `doc/html`.
The main page `doc/html/index.html` contains a detailed overview of the usage of libnabo.

Python bindings
===============

libnabo includes python bindings that are compiled if Python is available.
The resulting module is called pynabo, you can see an example in `python/test.py`.
You can find more information in the docstring-based documentation:

	python -c "import pynabo; help(pynabo.NearestNeighbourSearch)"

Building
--------

The Python bindings can be generated for Python 2 or Python 3.
To specify the version of the interpreter to use when building the bindings, set the `PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR` and `PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR` variables.
For example if you have both Python 2.7 and 3.5 installed, you could ask CMake to generate Python 3 bindings by using the following command.

    cmake -DPYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR=3 -DPYTHON_VERSION_MINOR=5 ..

On Debian-based distributions you may also need the `-DPYTHON_DEB_INSTALL_TARGET` option enabled.

Unit testing
============

The distribution of libnabo integrates a unit test module, based on CTest.
Just type:

	make test

...in the build directory to run the tests.
Their outputs are available in the `Testing` directory.
These consist of validation and benchmarking tests.
If [ANN] or [FLANN] are detected when compiling libnabo, `make test` will also perform comparative benchmarks.
